Chromatic Protocol provides a liquidity pool divided into multiple bins with different trading fee rates. The fee rate at which trades are executed is determined based on the dynamics of taker’s trading demand and maker’s liquidity supply. This dynamic fee system achieves a balanced maker-taker equilibrium, mitigating the inherent instability of closed systems like futures markets and significantly enhancing the sustainability of the protocol.\\n\\nFurthermore, Chromatic Protocol is a permissionless, open-source, non-upgradable protocol that enables the creation and trading of futures markets exposed to price feeds provided by an oracle. It is characterized by a minimalist, low-level, and unopinionated design. Market creators and participants can define customizable markets supported by the protocol to optimize and innovate, fostering a secure and optimized decentralized financial ecosystem.\\n\\nLastly, Chromatic Protocol is trustless and censorship-resistant. By eliminating trusted intermediaries and rent extraction commonly found in traditional futures markets, it ensures fair and capital-efficient trading by processing transactions based on smart contracts. Additionally, Chromatic prioritizes accessibility and censorship resistance, enabling anyone to freely participate in the decentralized financial market.","links":{"website":"https://www.chromatic.finance/","discord":"https://discord.gg/caDrC2nhgA","twitter":"https://twitter.com/chromatic_perp","github":"https://github.com/chromatic-protocol","coingecko":null,"news":null,"fundingNews":null,"video":null,"audit":null,"opensea":null},"meta":{"isLive":true,"isFeaturedOnHomePage":false,"isFeaturedOnCategoryPage":false,"isPublicallyAudited":false,"auditReportDate":null,"supportedPlatforms":[],"editorsNotes":"","nftMintDate":null,"foundedDate":null},"subcategories":[{"id":"48a0f7f4-d6df-4244-84ab-b978e3f2b77e","title":"DEX","slug":"dex","rank":1}]},{"id":"38cecdf6-b366-491d-a496-129a63537912","title":"Chronos","slug":"chronos","chains":["Arbitrum One"],"chainsMap":{"Arbitrum One":true},"images":{"logoUrl":"/images/projects/chronos-logo.webp","bannerUrl":"/images/projects/chronos-banner.webp"},"description":"Chronos is a revolutionary liquidity layer & AMM on Arbitrum Empowering LPs, Traders, Protocols & Users by optimizing the ve(3,3) model.","links":{"website":"https://chronos.exchange/","discord":"https://discord.com/invite/gTzrsdWgwD","twitter":"https://twitter.com/Chronosfi_","github":"https://github.com/ChronosEx/Chronos-Contracts/tree/main/contracts","coingecko":null,"news":null,"fundingNews":null,"video":null,"audit":null,"opensea":null},"meta":{"isLive":true,"isFeaturedOnHomePage":false,"isFeaturedOnCategoryPage":false,"isPublicallyAudited":false,"auditReportDate":null,"supportedPlatforms":[],"editorsNotes":"","nftMintDate":null,"foundedDate":null},"subcategories":[{"id":"48a0f7f4-d6df-4244-84ab-b978e3f2b77e","title":"DEX","slug":"dex","rank":1}]},{"id":"ae1c4455-3829-4bb8-bdd3-a330c14645a0","title":"CIAN Protocol","slug":"cian-protocol","chains":["Arbitrum One"],"chainsMap":{"Arbitrum One":true},"images":{"logoUrl":"/images/projects/cian-protocol-logo.webp","bannerUrl":"/images/projects/cian-protocol-banner.webp"},"description":"","links":{"website":"https://cian.app","discord":"https://discord.gg/cian","twitter":"https://twitter.com/CIAN_protocol","github":null,"coingecko":null,"news":null,"fundingNews":null,"video":null,"audit":null,"opensea":null},"meta":{"isLive":true,"isFeaturedOnHomePage":false,"isFeaturedOnCategoryPage":false,"isPublicallyAudited":false,"auditReportDate":null,"supportedPlatforms":[],"editorsNotes":"","nftMintDate":null,"foundedDate":null},"subcategories":[{"id":"37c2de04-8308-4ce5-bbe9-5530a04c0fa5","title":"DeFi (Other)","slug":"defi-other","rank":9}]},{"id":"89ad72b9-1017-4854-b51f-97d0f7f759d3","title":"citizend","slug":"citizend","chains":["Arbitrum One"],"chainsMap":{"Arbitrum One":true},"images":{"logoUrl":"/images/projects/citizend-logo.webp","bannerUrl":"/images/projects/citizend-banner.webp"},"description":"Community-curated token launch platform of web3, supporting both token community and public sales in Arbitrum and Ethereum","links":{"website":"https://citizend.xyz","discord":"https://discord.gg/sXDnhmQM","twitter":"https://twitter.com/citizendxyz","github":"https://github.com/subvisual/discoveryDAO","coingecko":null,"news":"https://twitter.com/OVioHQ/status/1773332329022287993","fundingNews":null,"video":null,"audit":null,"opensea":null},"meta":{"isLive":true,"isFeaturedOnHomePage":false,"isFeaturedOnCategoryPage":false,"isPublicallyAudited":false,"auditReportDate":null,"supportedPlatforms":[],"editorsNotes":"","nftMintDate":null,"foundedDate":null},"subcategories":[{"id":"37c2de04-8308-4ce5-bbe9-5530a04c0fa5","title":"DeFi (Other)","slug":"defi-other","rank":9}]},{"id":"41e28c4d-a358-4669-bb05-0fec9e614aae","title":"Civic","slug":"civic","chains":["Arbitrum One"],"chainsMap":{"Arbitrum One":true},"images":{"logoUrl":"/images/projects/civic-logo.webp","bannerUrl":"/images/projects/civic-banner.webp"},"description":"Civic is a tokenized identity solution for the verifiable web, empowering people to privately manage their identities across chains with an on-chain representation of their reusable identity.

It’s a dynamic, community-driven protocol that believes in giving back to its users.\\n\\nNot only do you enjoy a seamless swap experience, but you also pocket XNF tokens along the way. These XNF tokens, in turn, unlock the doors for you to earn coveted blue-chip tokens like ETH every 24 hours, all while nurturing the expansion of the Xenify ecosystem.\\n\\nHere’s the scoop: When you pay the 0.5% swap fee, you’ll snag locked XNF tokens (known as veXNF) during the upcoming daily reward distribution.
